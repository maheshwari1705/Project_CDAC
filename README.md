# Author: 
# Project Overview
# Objective: 
Use Monte Carlo simulations to price barrier options efficiently with OpenCL for parallel computing.

Barrier Option: A type of financial option where the payoff depends on whether the underlying asset's price reaches a certain barrier level during the option's life.
